# Util

This deserves a README because I generally hate 'util' packages and don't want to encourage them.  This should not grow,
and should in fact be stamped out as soon as anyone has a better idea for where this code should live.  Unfortunately
since the awfdata package is completely generated using an existing tool, it'd be difficult to splice in some helper
functions around the data as-is, so here we are.
